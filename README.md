# dotfiles

These are my `dotfiles`! :robot: :sparkles: 

## Usage

The entire installation was created using `Python`, so it is essential that you have the interpreter installed on your machine if you wish to install these dotfiles.

Installation is all via CLI. All types of installations and steps are defined in it. To run the CLI is very simple, just execute the following command at the root of this project:

```
python -m config.install --help
```
