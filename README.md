# dotfiles

:robot: These are my `dotfiles`! :sparkles:

## Usage

The entire installation was created using `Python`, so it is essential that you have the interpreter installed on your machine if you wish to install these dotfiles.

Installation is via CLI. All types of installations and steps are defined in it.

You will need to install the CLI dependencies to everything works correctly. These dependencies are installed via `pip`. Go to the root of the project (where the `requirements.txt` file is located) and run the following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now able to run the CLI. For you to read the instructions, run the following command:

```
python -m config.install --help
```
