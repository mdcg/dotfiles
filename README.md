# dotfiles

These are my `dotfiles`.

## Usage

First of all, make sure you have git installed on your machine:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

After installing git, clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mdcg/dotfiles.git
```

To use the installation script, go to the directory of the operating system you want to use (in the example below I am using Ubuntu) and run the installation script:

```
$ cd dotfiles/ubuntu/scripts/
$ ./install.sh
```
